Give a high level overview of how CSS grids work.

  - A grid is made up of a wrapper (parent) and the items (children). A display of grid is used to turn a div into a grid. The grid consists of columns and rows, which can be defined with grid-template-columns/grid-template-rows. The child items can be positioned and resized by grid-column-start/grid-column-end.
