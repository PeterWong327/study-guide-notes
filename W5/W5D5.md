- Explain how this can be solved in linear time.
  - Finding a pair in an array whose sum is closest to a given x can be solved in linear time by using a while loop (while first index l is < the last index r). A variable diff is initialized as infinity, and the result is initialized as an empty string. Using the while loop, check if the absolute value of the sum of the first and last value minus x is less than diff. If it is, then the new value is the new diff, and the result is both values. If the sum is less than x, then increment l. Else, decrement r. Once the loop ends, return the result.
