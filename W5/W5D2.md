- Explain how you can still find an element in log time when the array is rotated.
  - You can still find an element in log time when the array is rotated because once you find the pivot element where the array was rotated at, you can perform a binary search on the left and right side of the pivot element. The pivot element is the only element where the element to the right is smaller than it. The binary search would then be performed in in log n time.
