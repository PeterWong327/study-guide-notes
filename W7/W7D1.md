- What is the time complexity of inserting into a sorted singly-linked LL? How can you do it in one pass only?
  - The time complexity of inserting into a sorted singly-linked list is O(n). You can do it in one pass only by looping through each node in a linked list until you find a node X who's next node Y is greater than the node to be inserted Z. Then change the pointer of Z's next to be pointing to Y, and change the pointer of X's next to be pointing to Z.
