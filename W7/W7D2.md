- How may we compare two strings using a Linked List?
  - To compare two strings using a linked list:
    1. Traverse both lists until either end of a list is reached or the current characters do not match.
    2. If both lists are not empty, compare the characters that do not match (return 1 if first list is greater than second list, else return -1.)
    3. If either of the lists reached the end while the other did not, return 1 if first list still exists, or return 2 if second list still exists.
    4. Return 0 at the end (both strings match).
