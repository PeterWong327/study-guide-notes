- How might you detect and remove a cycle in a Linked List?
  - You can detect and remove a cycle in a Linked List by setting 2 pointers: 1 for the head, another for the kth node from head (where k is the number of nodes in the loop). Moving both pointers at the same pace, they will meet at the starting node of the loop. Remove the cycle by changing the pointer of the last node of loop and setting its next as null.


- Why might messages get delivered in the wrong order?
  - Messages might get delivered in the wrong order when there are multiple servers transferring the messages. If one server is not available at the time of the message being sent, then another available server may send another one of your messages first.
