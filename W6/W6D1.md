- What are the steps to detecting a cycle in a graph?
  1. Allocate memory for creating V subsets (where V is number of vertices).
  2. Initialize all subsets as single element sets.
  3. Iterate through all edges of the graph, find subset of both vertices of every edge. Return true if both subsets are the same.


- What is currying?
  - Currying is translating a function from callable as 'f(a, b, c)' into callable as 'f(a)(b)(c)'.


- What extra features do you get when using lodash.curry?
  - When using lodash.curry, it returns a wrapper that allows a function to be called normally when all arguemnts are supplied or returns a partial otherwise.


- Why might you use currying?
  - You use currying to be able to keep the function callable normally and to get partials easily.


- What is the rationale for writing services?


- What are the 9 areas of inquiry that you you should define from a high level before diving into implementation?
  1. Features (figure out what to include/exclude)
  2. Define APIs (who/how the APIs will be called for the features)
  3. Availability (determine how available the service will be if host/server goes down)
  4. Latency Performance (background or customer-facing requests)
  5. Scalability (would it work for 100, 1000, or 1 million users?)
  6. Durability (can data be stored in database securely, won't get lost/compromised?)
  7. Class Diagram (how would the class be designed using object-oriented principles)
  8. Security and Privacy (design an authentication system?)
  9. Cost effective (is it cost effective? Alternate solution?)
