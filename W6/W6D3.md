- Explain the decision to use 7 characters for the tinyURL
  - Using 7 characters for tinyURL makes sense because there are 62 different characters that can be used. With 7 characters, there can be up to ~3.5 trillion combinations of URLs created. Even at the rate of a thousand tinyURLs per second, it would take 110 years to exhaust all possible combinations.


- How do you turn a random number between 1 and 3.5 trillion into a 7 character string?
  - By representing the random number with 43 bits, which would convert into a 7 character string.


- What is the downside to just generating a random string, checking the db and putting it if it doesn't exist?
  - The downside is that while the tinyURL is being stored with the corresponding long URL, another worker thread for another request could be putting the same tiny URL for some other long URL into the database. The result is that one of the longer URL will become corrupted.


- What is the downside to generating a random string, putting into the DB, getting and checking they are the same?
  - The downside is that it might take a long time (infinite) to look through all the URLs that do not exist in the database.
