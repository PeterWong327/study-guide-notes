- Explain Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm.
  -Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm is used to find the subgraph that is a tree and connects all vertices together, in a connected and undirected graph. It has V-1 edges, where V is the number of vertices in the given graph. It also has a weight less than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree. First, sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of the weights. Then pick the smallest edge and check if it forms a cycle with the spanning tree formed. If no cycle is formed, then include the edge. If a cycle is formed, do not include the edge. Keep picking the next smallest edge until there are V-1 edges in the subgraph.

- Explain floats and clears
  - Float (left, right, none, or inherit) is a position property in CSS, which allows an element to remain a part of the flow of the web page, so that text can flow around the element. If an image uses float, resizing the image would allow the surrounding text to reflow to fit. Clear (both, left, right, none) is used on elements to prevent the other elements from floating on either side of the given element.

- What is a Trie?


- What might you want to store in each node in your Trie?


- How do you handle it when your Trie becomes too large to be stored on one machine?


- How would you collect and update the top results for a certain node in the Trie?
