- What is the Floyd-Warchall algorithm good for?
  - The Floyd-Warchall algorithm is used for finding the shortest distances between every pair of vertices in a given edge weighted directed graph.


- How does it work?
  - The Floyd-Warchall algorithm works by initializing a result matrix with the same data as the input graph matrix. The result matrix is then updated by going through all the vertices as an intermediate vertex k. Looping through i, j, and k from 1 to the number of vertices V in the graph, the lesser of the two distances (dist[i][j] or dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]) would then be updated in the result matrix as the shortest distance. The time complexity would be O(V^3) because of looping through i, j, and k to V.
