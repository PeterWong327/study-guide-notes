- What other problems have similar solutions?
  - Another problem that has a similar solution is finding the number of islands in a boolean 2D matrix.


- Explain the difference between inline and inline block.
  - Inline is the default property of all elements, it will accept margin and padding, but the element will still sit inline, pushing other elements horizontally away (not vertically).

  - display: block causes the elements to not sit inline, and take up as much horizontal space as possible.


- What does position relative and absolute do?


- What is the MD5 based approach? Advantages/disadvantages?


- Explain the counter based approach
