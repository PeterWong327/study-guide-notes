- What other problems have similar solutions?
  - Another problem that has a similar solution is finding the number of islands in a boolean 2D matrix.


- Explain the difference between inline and inline block.
  - Inline is the default property of all elements, it will accept margin and padding, but the element will still sit inline, pushing other elements horizontally away (not vertically). Inline block is similar to inline (keeps element with natural flow of text), but the width and height properties would apply.


- Explain display: block
  - display: block causes the elements to not sit inline, and take up as much horizontal space as possible.


- What does position relative and absolute do?
  - 'Position: relative' moves the element away from its original position, the direction and magnitude to be defined in the child element (ex. top: 20px). Position absolute removes the element from the flow of the document and other elements will act as if the target element does not exist (positional properties still exist).
